<i><b>ILoveNougat app: </b>A demo project for Zappos's intern hiring challenge.</i>

<p>The App has three basic functionalities:</p>
<p>1. Display list of products from the Zappos endpoint API based on search term.</p>
<p>2. On clicking each product, the same product is searched on 6PM and prices of both products are compared,
  with the cheaper one being displayed to the user.</p>
<p>3. Each product also has a 'Share' button which sends a product link to another user through mail.
  The link can only be opened if the user has the app installed on their phone, and will display the shared product to the user
  with a link to the equivalent Zappos weblink of the same.</p>
